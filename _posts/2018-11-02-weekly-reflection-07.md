# Connections and Reflections (Monday)

Brand new week for APCSP and the first class of this week was 7th period and it started with a 'do now' of two expressions that were in a circle form as there was a large circle with a multiplyer, and then a smaller circle with addition. There were two of these and in the language of math they were 3(7 + 10) and 3(11 + 10). We basically had to compare and contrast these two to see the similarities and differences. A key simliarity was that both of the expressions added before they multiplied, while a huge difference was that the two expressions are identical, besides for the '7' and '11'. The teacher then said when reviewing the 'do now' that the 7 or 11 could be a variable in a function. He then proceeded to show us how to code functions in pyret by using these two 'do now' problems as examples. The code shown was the following:
```
fun f(x): 3 * (x + 10)
```
This was our introduction to creating functions in pyret and it didn't stop there, after the 'do now' and the mini-lesson was done, we got about 20 minutes on computers to try out 16 word problems in which we had to create functions for them. I got to about halfway until our 20 minutes were over and then the teacher called us over back to our seats to discuss how to help us out if we were struggling with some of the word problems. He showed us a base layout for the 1st word problem in which he started off with something similar to what was showed after the 'do now' in the previous mini lesson, but then added on as he showed us how to code contracts for our functions, but also test cases to make sure that our functions worked. We then went back to computers at where we the continued to work on the word problems, but now incorporating the contracts and test cases. We kept doing this for some time, and eventually the period came to an end. As a whole, a connection to prior work we completed would be
