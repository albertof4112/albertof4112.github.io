# Monday Reflection

Monday was basically just an intro day to our 2 week project on flags that is meant to prepare us for a the real college project we will need to complete later in the year. We started off class by dividing everbody into 6 groups based on where they sat at in their table. This determined which two flags we could select from, one flag being up to a practioner grade-wise, and another more challenging flag up to professional. The two flags I was given to choose from were Cuba and Pakistan. I choose Pakistan because it was the one that could give me up to a professional. When we choose our flags, we were tasked to do research on them by using fotw.info to see the dimensions, ratios, and lengths of the flag. The Pakistan flag looked like it provided a cchallenge, but nothing too difficult. I started working on it in pyret and I basically just need to get two circles to overlap to create the illusion of a crescent, and learn how to rotate a star and position it where it needs to be. Easier said than done but 7 more classes to do this is plenty.

# Thursday/friday Reflection

I'm going to skip wednesday's reflection but am still going to incorporate the aspects of it as it was day 1 of our flag collages. Besides that though, the teacher also wants us to stop summarizing what we do daily/weekly, so don't mind whats above.

On Thursday we had a fairly relaxed day as half the grade was out on a trip, so the teachers didn't feel like giving out work and the students didn't feel like doing work. Due to this, in AP CSP we basically had 2 seminar discussions on which direction the class as a whole should go in, but also how we feel about our current flag project. In the warm up for the day, we were asked what is wrong with the current flag project and if we were to start from scratch again, what should be added, what we want to learn, or what should be token away. I put down that I want to learn more about the tilt degree of the Pakistan star, the angle of the crescent, and that we have limited-ish supplies, all the flag colors provided, work at computers when doing collages to have instant research. After this the first seminar took place and some of the notes I took on it were that people want a lot more time with the project, better transition from the computer to paper, more explanation in our tasks, are the other (Bunin) classes ahead of us?, good job to the teacher in being invloved, that we are looking forward to what we want to learn in the future, and to provide extra optional practice for core topics on the test.
