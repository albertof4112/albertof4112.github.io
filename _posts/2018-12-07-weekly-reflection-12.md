# Monday Reflection

Monday was basically just an intro day to our 2 week project on flags that is meant to prepare us for a the real college project we will need to complete later in the year. We started off class by dividing everbody into 6 groups based on where they sat at in their table. This determined which two flags we could select from, one flag being up to a practioner grade-wise, and another more challenging flag up to professional. The two flags I was given to choose from were Cuba and Pakistan. I choose Pakistan because it was the one that could give me up to a professional. When we choose our flags, we were tasked to do research on them by using fotw.info to see the dimensions, ratios, and lengths of the flag. The Pakistan flag looked like it provided a cchallenge, but nothing too difficult. I started working on it in pyret and I basically just need to get two circles to overlap to create the illusion of a crescent, and learn how to rotate a star and position it where it needs to be. Easier said than done but 7 more classes to do this is plenty.
