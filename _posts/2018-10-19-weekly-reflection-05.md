# Our Learning (Monday)
Starting of the period on Monday, we had APCSP for last period and the starting do now was to draw a rectangle with a circle and ellipse inside of it. After this, we had to create this image in pyret. We did this to practice coding our flags and to get better at doing overlay code in pyret. We then talked about how to do the do now and how to do three-shape overlays to help build our flags. After this for about ten minutes, we went off to code our flags for the rest of the period, where we were told that we will have another day (Wednesday) to finish our flags if we needed too.

# My Learning (Monday)
I got on my computer when we were told to go on for our do now's and had no issue coding the three main shapes of a red rectangle, green ellipse, and blue circle. The problems arrived when I tried to overlay more than 2 shapes, which I didn't know how to do. I asked the peers near me since we mainly worked together on the do now, and they weren't sure either. As explained in the other part of our learning, we were then taught this in the do now reflection. I took this knowledge and was able to finish my Bangladesh flag in about 10 minutes since it was pretty simple and I didn't really need the 3 shape overlay. Even though I did finish this first Bangladesh flag, I'm going to work on another flag for something a little bit more challenging.
