Starting off this second weekly reflection, on Monday we had APCSP last period and began with the agenda but then whent into the main 
video game section of the class. We were basically told to split up into teams of 3 and find a video game on the internet, which then 
we had to answer 3 questions. What things are in the game?, What things are changing?, and How are they changing? We completed the task, 
answered the questions on the whiteboard, and then one team went up and presented. Only one group went because we were low on time and 
had to take a google form web quiz. This was about 10 questions and was what we ended the period with. After this, we did a game coordinates lecture on Wednesday. We all took notes on mathematical coordinates, and then video game coordinates. Most of the content in the lecture wasn't new because in our previous 9th grade year, we created a video game on WeScheme and used key video game coordinates. To further understand them though, we played a game of "battleship" where we divided a giant white erase board with 3 lines vertically and 3 lines horizontally, and basically could only put our "ships" on multiples of 25 and 0 (0,25,50,75,100). It was 3 versus three and it took up most of our time. Unfortunately my team lost, and it was basically the end of the period for Wednesday. We had APCSP second period on Thursday and we simply applied our knowledge of game coordinates from our previous lecture, to actual code. The class went on this website called "pyret" and applied the code and game coordinates notes to create a ball dropping and a sunset setting.We also did ball drop flip books beforehand, but besides that, it was basically the day for this class.
