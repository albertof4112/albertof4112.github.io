Starting off this second weekly reflection, on Monday we had APCSP last period and began with the agenda but then whent into the main 
video game section of the class. We were basically told to split up into teams of 3 and find a video game on the internet, which then 
we had to answer 3 questions. What things are in the game?, What things are changing?, and How are they changing? We completed the task, 
answered the questions on the whiteboard, and then one team went up and presented. Only one group went because we were low on time and 
had to take a google form web quiz. This was about 10 questions and was what we ended the period with. After this, we did ___ on 
Wednesday.
