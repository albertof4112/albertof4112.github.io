This week we had monday off due to columbus day, so we are going to have one reflection less thatn ususal. We also don't have APCSP on tuesday so the reflections start with wednesday first period. Today in APCSP class, we were basically tasked with researching the library that pyret has to offer, and try to use the definitions and code it has, to make our flag on pyret. The pyret library can be accessed by signing in with a google account, going to the top left corner on the editor, going to documentation, builtins and libraries, and then for this APCSP class, we went to 3.19 image. In class we also defined the term API, which means apllication programming interface. After we did this though, we worked on inputting our flags into pyret, and before I knew it the period was almost over. We were told the gameplan for the next two days (thursday and friday) which were pair programming, and then working on our blogs for friday.
