For this week and onward, the APCSP teacher told us add more and more detail for our weekly reflections, so I'll definitely try on this 
one a bit more. Anyways, we started the period on Monday with writing a short blurb about what we will do in class for Monday. The blurb 
was basically about us styling our websites in css. After this, we did a do now that basically involved different ways we can make a 
calendar. Some ideas I made up were in the formats of grids, table, venn diagram, the sun, list, and more. We talked about these forms 
of calendars and then moved onto talking our actualides and concepts we share in class, and how we should meet the teacher halfway 
with our ideas and thoughts of the class. We then went on colourpallets.com and were told to find a nice asthetically 
pleasing color pallet that we liked, write it down, and then apply it to our GitHub website. We did exactly this, but wanted to see
instant results, so we went on thimble since GitHub takes some time to respond to updates. After practicing css style on thimble, we 
wrote down what happened in class for the day, and organized for now, the reflection of the day for Monday.

Next up, we have first period APCSP on Wednesday the class was given a worksheet with a foundatioin of code for our webpages. It was
basically the starter code for our GitHub websites and what we had to do was describe the structure of the HTML pages. I started doing this by listing tags on the HTML, and describing what I think they do. We then as a class, tried to list out every HTML tag and tried to determine whether or not the tag had a start and end. We then went on w3schools.com and researched some tags that we didn't know all about. Then the class as a whole described some of the lesser known tags and then left two remaining. Me and my partner went up and explained the tags, (which were "<ul>" and "<li>") and then gave quick reviews on each tag. We overall did this entire lesson today to explore new HTML tags, and learn them to apply them to our  website. After I explained "<ul>" and "<li>", that was basically the end of the day regarding APCSP.
