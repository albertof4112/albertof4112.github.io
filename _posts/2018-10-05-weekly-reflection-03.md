For this week and onward, the APCSP teacher told us add more and more detail for our weekly reflections, so I'll definitely try on this 
one a bit more. Anyways, we started the period on Monday with writing a short blurb about what we will do in class for Monday. The blurb 
was basically about us styling our websites in css. After this, we did a do now that basically involved different ways we can make a 
calendar. Some ideas I made up were in the formats of grids, table, venn diagram, the sun, list, and more. We talked about these forms 
of calendars and then moved onto talking our actualides and concepts we share in class, and how we should meet the teacher halfway 
with our ideas and thoughts of the class. We then went on colourpallets.com and were told to find a nice asthetically 
pleasing color pallet that we liked, write it down, and then apply it to our GitHub website. We did exactly this, but wanted to see
instant results, so we went on thimble since GitHub takes some time to respond to updates. After practicing css style on thimble, we 
wrote down what happened in class for the day, and organized for now, the reflection of the day for Monday.

Next up, we have first period APCSP on Wednesday the class was given a worksheet with a foundatioin of code for our webpages. It was
basically the starter code for our GitHub websites and what we had to do was describe the structure of the HTML pages. I started doing this by listing tags on the HTML, and describing what I think they do. We then as a class, tried to list out every HTML tag and tried to determine whether or not the tag had a start and end. We then went on w3schools.com and researched some tags that we didn't know all about. Then the class as a whole described some of the lesser known tags and then left two remaining. Me and my partner went up and explained the tags, (which were >ul< and >li<) and then gave quick reviews on each tag. We overall did this entire lesson today to explore new HTML tags, and learn them to apply them to our  website. After I explained >ul< and >li<, that was basically the end of the day regarding APCSP.

Following wednesday, we of course have thursday APCSP. I had the class on 2nd period and started it off with a diagnostic do now. This diaognostic was given to us to feel out where we are at in terms of our learned skill from APCSP. An example of the problems on the diagnostic was "create a problem where if a number is greater than 0, add 1, and if a number is less than 0, add 1." Also, we were allowed to solve these problems in any language we choose, whether it be math, html, css, etc. I did about 3 of these problems in the 20 minutes were given to do these and primary did them in math. After this, we were given a mini lecture on flags and then went on a flag website where we were told to choose a flag, and then code it in pyret. We also got a sheet with a translation of code from bootstrap to pyret (since we did flags in bootstrap last year). I personally chose a pretty simple flag to do, the Bangledesh flag. The class did their own thing on the computers, coding flags, and then we all got back to our tables to dicuss what we did and reflect on out flags. After some people reflected on their flags, our time was up, and it was the end of the period for APCSP.

Last day of the school week and last period of the school week until our 3 day weekend (Columbus Day) we had APCSP where we started off the period by being told we were going to do arts and crafts for the whole period. The thing we were going to be crafting was the flags we previoously researched. We had to make a blueprint for how we were going to build the flags and all the shapes we were going to incorporate into the flags. I created my layout, using a ruler, a compass, and my pencil, and got the first part done on making my Bangledesh flag. After this, I used precise measurements, scissors, and glue to create an accurate portrail of the Bangledesh flag. I wasn't quite able to finish, but out teacher said that we will have more time next week. This specific class was supposed to teach us how to layer and overlap shapes and other items of sort, to them but them into code.
