For this week and onward, the APCSP teacher told us add more and more detail for our weekly reflections, so I'll definitely try on this 
one a bit more. Anyways, we started the period on Monday with writing a short blurb about what we will do in class for Monday. The blurb 
was basically about us styling our websites in css. After this, we did a do now that basically involved different ways we can make a 
calendar. Some ideas I made up were in the formats of grids, table, venn diagram, the sun, list, and more. We talked about these forms 
of calendars and then moved onto talking our actualides and concepts we share in class, and how we should meet the teacher halfway with our
ideas and thoughts of the class. We then went on colourpallets.com and were told to find a nice asthetically pleasing color pallet that we 
liked, write it down, and then apply it to our GitHub website. We did exactly this, but wanted to see instant results, so we went on 
thimble since GitHub takes some time to respond to updates. After practicing css style on thimble, we wrote down what happened in class for 
the day, and organized for now, the reflection of the day for Monday.
