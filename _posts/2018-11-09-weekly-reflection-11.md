# Comeback Reflection:

Welcome back to my weekly reflections of which I have skipped two because of how little AP CSP classes I've had over the past two weeks. This will be the start to the return, the resurgence of the weekly reflections. Ironicly, for this weekly reflection we don't have a weekly reflection, we have a test reflection. This week we had 3 classes of AP CSP instead of 4 due to Friday being a half-day allowing us to not have the class for the 4th time. In classic test/midterm week fasion, Monday was a baseline test and time to review for the real one, Wednesday was the actual test, and Thursday was the time to look back on the test and see how we could improve. I got about a 70% on the test, but thats not what matters because what is important is getting better at it for the real test in May. I mostly got caught up on the questions that needed me to think deeper on topics we haven't really learned about. Mostly practitioner level  MS 5/MS 3 questions. Overall though, I'm going to practice these specific types of questions in class, and try my best to be active in any future review of this type of exam. Looking forward onto next week though, the teacher said that we are going to expand upon our flag projects we started in October so that we can have 1 of 2 project submitted to the college board.
