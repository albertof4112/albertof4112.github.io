So here it is, my first ever actual blog post about what I have learned this week in APCSP. And since I didn't blog about the very first and second weeks here is that.

Very first week of class wasn't very detailed because it was the first one and it was mostly just an introduction to the year and a call for supplies. For APCSP we mainly talked about the course and the exam, and the or homework had to write an entire notecard of notes on <h3.1><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf">this</a></h3.1> pdf. file. This pdf. is basically the entire APCSP textbook minus the heavy book. We will probably refer to this again, so make sure you keep an eye on it. Also, we made textbooks stand with notecards.

After this, there's the second week of class, in which we talked about the course a little more, but also did some type of diagnostic-like tests for the class. These were in the language of math, and basically allowed us to feel out a little of the course but also to give our teacher general statistics on how we reacted to a basic math tests.

Now, for the reflection on the first "real" week of class. At the beginning of the week, we were introduced to GitHub (which is the host of this very website) which was where we were going to build learning blogs with weekly reflections on our own personal website. We were showed a link to another blog that basically was a 17-part tutorial for building the foundation of our blogs. This tutorial was pretty useful as it demonstrated how to code the 'home' and 'blog' parts of our site. We worked on this site for practically the whole week in class, and as per the teacher, about 90% of students set up their website fully (as in line to the tutorial). Personally, I finished my website a little bit earlier, so I was able to mess around with the colors and links of my website. This was basically it though in terms of the first "real" week of APCSP.
