So here it is, my first ever actual blog post about what I have learned this week in APCSP. And since I didn't blog about the very first and second weeks here is that.

Very first week of class wasn't very detailed because it was the first one and it was mostly just an introduction to the year and a call for supplies. For APCSP we mainly talked about the course and the exam, and the or homework had to write an entire notecard of notes on "this" pdf. file.
