I have to do a reflection for the end of the year in Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles, so here it is. This class was (almost) 2 full high school semesters and required 3 parts for the full assesment grade for the college credit granted by the College Board. The three parts are the create performance task, explore performance task, and multiple choice test. Throughout the entire year we prepared for the create performance task with flag and data table projects. The explore? not so much. The multiple choice test? nope. Those flag and data table pieces took up most of the year and weren't too bad. The year later progressed though and it was time to make the actual create performance task, which I did based off the countries data table.
