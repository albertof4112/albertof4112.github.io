# Connections and Reflections (Monday)

Alright so on Monday APCSP was last period and our do now basically was a paper with a bunch of different question on subjects like sports, pop culture, politics, and education. We choose which questions we could answer and which questions we would want to be answered and then talked about why. The teacher went around to some students and asked which questions did they pick and why. (<b> Personal Moment </b>) I was picked to reflect on my question choice and I chose 'Sports: Who is the greatest QB of all time?'. I chose this question because I enjoy watching football, thought that I could answer it pretty easily, but also wanted to hear other answer to the question. After we did this do now though, we smoothly transitioned into the main lesson and work of today's class, which was observing some small table sample code on pyret, and writing what we see on the code, and what we wonder. After this, we wrote two sentences on these two things and posted them to a discussion on google classroom. Once we did this, we had to respond to two other classmates with their responses on what the observe and wonder. Basically the whole class did this and I personally observed that the code showed two shapes tand the amount of corners of the shapes in a table format. When we were done doing this, we were told to save the program to out google drives, which means we are potentially going to keep working on this program, and continue building our pyret skill plus knowledge on table-making. This lesson and program for the day could connect to our flag making as it was done on pyret and needed us to use shapes and numbers to insert facts about shapes on a table, but also connects to a prior lesson where we reviewed some pre-typed code, and then gave our input on it. The only difference with this lesson and the one from before is that it looks like we are going to go more in-depth into this shapes and tables one.
