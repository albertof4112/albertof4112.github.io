# Connections and Reflections (Monday)

Alright so on Monday APCSP was last period and our do now basically was a paper with a bunch of different question on subjects like sports, pop culture, politics, and education. We choose which questions we could answer and which questions we would want to be answered and then talked about why. The teacher went around to some students and asked which questions did they pick and why. (<b> Personal Moment </b>) I was picked to reflect on my question choice and I chose 'Sports: Who is the greatest QB of all time?'. I chose this question because I enjoy watching football, thought that I could answer it pretty easily, but also wanted to hear other answer to the question. After we did this do now though, we smoothly transitioned into the main lesson and work of today's class, which was observing some small table sample code on pyret, and writing what we see on the code, and what we wonder.----
